New Trading Assistant for Me


Here is the plan:
- This is basically going to use my trading history to make sure that I am making good trades moving forward. There is a real cost basis, there is also a "zero line"
where every time you make a profit the line moves down. This is the cushion you have within a trade before you actually lose money.

There are issues we are trying to solve:
- You know when you close out a trade, take a profit, but then the stock keeps going up, and you're like "do I buy back in? I dont want to ruin my profits,
this seems like a risk," but idk how much of a risk. We can solve this issue.

The goal:
- To increase the annual growth of my stock portfolio by better understanding the impact of each one of my trades.

Some thoughts:
- Doesnt have to be connected to tda or alpaca. This would make it easier to use, but can be down without it.
    - Just required more work from the user
